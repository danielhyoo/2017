      notes: >
        The *Real Stats* readings should be mostly review. Use them and the
        two *Nature* pieces to refresh yourself on regression.

        Scan the *PS* symposium to get a sense of where political science research
        methods are and are goings. Angrist and Pischke and Dunning provide
        background to the "causal inference revolution". In particular, understand the
        difference between "design based" and "model based" methods of inference.
        The Freedmand and Berk articles discuss the limitations, or rather, the proper
        uses of regression, and stats, more generally.

            This is effectively a commentary on where methodology goes from here. Scan the various articles to get the gist of the different viewpoints.

            Becoming dated, but it touches on changes in methodology throughout the history of political science. This, along with King (1991) is
            to give you a big picture overview of the history of methodology in the discipline as some of the other papers
            provide a recent view of developments.
